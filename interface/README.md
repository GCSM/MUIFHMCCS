=========

All Laravel files go in the "laravel" folder. Set up your apache document root to point to the "laravel" folder and you should have a working, version controlled website (you'll have to migrate the database, see [this guide](http://laravelbook.com/laravel-migrations-managing-databases/)).

All other non laravel stuff can go here in this folder, such as documentation.
